### 📈 Bufferbloat Optimization:

We have integrated a powerful script from [Khorvie Tech](https://github.com/Khorvie-Tech/bufferbloat) to tackle bufferbloat issues. Bufferbloat occurs when network latency increases due to excessive buffering, especially during high-bandwidth usage. 

#### Features:
- **Advanced Registry Changes:** Applies tweaks to optimize TCP/IP settings for lower latency.
- **Compatible with Modern Windows Versions:** Ensures smooth operation with the latest Windows builds.
- **Easy to Use:** The script runs seamlessly as part of the NSR process.

#### Testing Results:
To verify the improvements, we recommend using [WAVEFORM - Bufferbloat and Internet Speed Test](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat) or similar tools.
